            <p>Living a sinful life or making sinful choices can cause problems in your life. God is not to be blamed
                for your problems, especially when the cause of your problems is a sinful choice or life. Sometimes we
                can make wrong choices on our own that land us into problems. Therefore when we live a sinful life, we
                then separate ourselves from God and because of sin our perspective and our approach to life's problems
                become ungodly.But your iniquities have separated you from your God; And your sins have hidden His
                face</p>
            <p>People who have overcome abuse, a tragedy or any type of problems are more effectively able to comfort,
                empathize and counsel a person who is going through similar circumstances.Brethren, if a man is
                overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness,
                considering yourself lest you also be tempted. Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of
                Christ.</p>
            <p>God is more interested in you developing your character and becoming mature so that in Christ, you can
                cope with anything that life may throw at you. When you face problems, it might be that God wants to
                teach you specific values and virtues through your problems such as patience, perseverance, love, faith
                and the like.My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing
                of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and
                complete, lacking nothing. </p>
            <p>Ultimately God also wants you to know Him and to know His character. God can use problems to change your
                perspective about life and about Him. For example, some people who have had sickness or near-death
                experiences have been known to radically and positively change their outlook on life. Therefore God can
                use problems to help you refocus your perspective and to view Him and His plans for your life more
                correctly.“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,” says the Lord. “For as
                the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your
                thoughts. </p>
