            <p>In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert information—such as a
                letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
                communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is the
                invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw,
                heard or felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry,
                and limits the audience to those present when the speech is uttered . The invention of writing, which
                converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and
                time. The process of encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or
                storage. Decoding is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient
                understands, such as English or/and Spanish. One reason for coding is to enable communication in places
                where ordinary plain language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore,
                where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of
                the message, typically individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can
                interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.</p>
